dogcloud
===

Herein lays the source code to my own little personal cloud. I am providing it
as is for educational purposes, I don't run any serious stuff using this as of
today.

## What it does

The dogcloud provides a graphql backend running on top of AWS lambda, along with
a graphql explorer for this graph and a gatsby front-end which talks to it.

## Usage

This should probably be a monorepo but..... oh well. See the `packages`
directory. `cd` into each one of these directories and run `yarn` then `yarn
start`. You should boot the `dog-graph` first. For more details see each
packages' own README file.
