jcloud
===


Herein lays the source code to my own little personal cloud. I am providing it
as is for educational purposes, I don't run any serious stuff using this as of
today (May 21).

## What it does

The `jcloud` provides a graphql backend running on top of AWS lambda, along with
a graphql explorer for this graph and a gatsby front-end which talks to it.

## Usage

This should probably be a mono-repo but..... oh well. See the `packages`
directory. `cd` into each one of these directories and run `yarn` then `yarn
start`. You should boot `jgraph` first. For more details see each packages' own
README file.


## Contributing

Fork this repo. Make some commits. Send me a PR. Easy peasy.
